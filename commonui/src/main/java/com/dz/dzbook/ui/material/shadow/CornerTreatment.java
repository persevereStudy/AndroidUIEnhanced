     * <p>CornerTreatments are assumed to have an origin of (0, 0) (i.e. they represent the
     * top-left
     * corner), and are automatically rotated and scaled as necessary when applied to other
     * corners.
     *
     * @param angle         the angle of the corner, typically 90 degrees.
     * @param interpolation the interpolation of the corner treatment. Ranges between 0 (none) and 1
     *                      (fully) interpolated. Custom corner treatments can implement
     *                      interpolation to support shape transition between two arbitrary states.
     *                      Typically, a value of 0 indicates that the custom corner treatment is
     *                      not rendered (i.e. that it is a 90 degree angle), and a value of 1
     *                      indicates that the treatment is fully rendered. Animation between these
     *                      two values can "heal" or "reveal" a corner treatment.
     * @param shapePath     the {@link ShapePath} that this treatment should write to.
